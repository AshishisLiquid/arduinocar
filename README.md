- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on **Arduino Project (Arduino Car)**

- ü§ù Person who helped me in this project [Poonam Kumawat](https://github.com/poonam-kumawat).

- ‚ö° Fun fact **It has 3 Modes right now, which are Robotic Car, Obstacle Avoiding and Line following. As we will be experiment or researching on it for add more modules in it. It would be great if you leave Star check**


# About ArduinoCar
 Android controlled arduino robot car  make use of an Android mobile phone for robotic control with the help of HC-05 Bluetooth technology. This is a simple robotics projects using arduino microcontroller. This project is a bluetooth controlled robot. For this the android mobile user has to install an application on her/his mobile. This android application could be downloaded in the android market.

 Then user needs to turn on the bluetooth in the mobile. The wireless communication techniques used to control the robot is bluetooth technology. User can use various commands like move forward, reverse, stop move left, move right. These commands are sent from the Android mobile to the bluetooth receiver which is interfaced with the Arduino robot.

Android based robot has a HC-05 Bluetooth receiver unit which receives the commands and give it to the microcontroller circuit to control the motors. The microcontroller then transmits the signal to the motor driver IC‚Äôs to operate the motors.
